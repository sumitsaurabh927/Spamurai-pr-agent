## üìñ Overview
Close spammy PRs intelligently - This GitHub App automatically monitors pull requests, posts comments, and closes if they are spammy (based on conditions you decide). 

It has been built using [Motia.dev](https://motia.dev) ‚Äî an AI Agent Framework Built for Engineers, and it:
- uses a local server (tunneled via [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)) to receive webhook events, 
- interacts with [GitHub‚Äôs REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28),
- uses [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) for PR analysis, contextual comments and recommended action, and
- posts intelligent comment and perform recommended action.

## ‚ú® What This App Does

- üß† Posts automated contextual comments on Pull Requests
- üõë Closes PRs based on custom logic that you can define and change
- üß© Listens to GitHub webhook events using a local server
- üöÄ Uses [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) to analyse PRs and generate intelligent messages
- ‚òùÔ∏è Uses PR diffs to analyse PRs and matches PR title/description with the diff, so that the comments are always contextual
- üí° Built entirely using [Motia.dev](https://motia.dev) to showcase how fast you can go from zero to awesome!

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumitsaurabh927/Spamurai-pr-agent
   cd spamurai
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   pnpm start
   ```

5. Run ngrok to expose your local server:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

6. Create and configure your GitHub App (see [GitHub App Setup](#github-app-setup) section).

7. Update the webhook URL in your GitHub App settings with your ngrok URL.

8. Install the app on your desired repository.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
GITHUB_PAT=your_personal_access_token
GITHUB_APP_ID=your_github_app_id
GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Notes:
- For `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`, make sure to include the entire RSA key with newlines replaced by `\n`. You can convert it using this command: `awk 'NF {sub(/\r/, ""); printf "%s\\n",$0;}' private-key.pem`
- Generate a random string for `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (you'll use this when setting up the GitHub App)

### GitHub App Setup

1. Go to your [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click "New GitHub App" and fill in the details:
   - **Name**: Give your app a unique name (Spamurai)
   - **Homepage URL**: Your project's homepage or repository URL
   - **Webhook URL**: Your ngrok URL (see below) + `/webhooks/github` (e.g., `https://5316-2401-4900-4e7e-90f5-5d65-9a3f-9f74-787f.ngrok-free.app/webhooks/github`)
   - **Webhook Secret**: The same value you used for `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

3. Set the required permissions:
   - **Repository permissions**:
     - Contents: Read & write
     - Issues: Read & write
     - Pull requests: Read & write
     - Metadata: Read-only (mandatory)

4. Subscribe to the following events:
   - Issue comment
   - Pull request
   - Pull request review
   - Push

5. After creating the app, note your **App ID** and generate a **private key** (download it).

### Setting Up Webhooks with ngrok

For local development, you need to expose your local server to the internet using ngrok:

1. Start your application server:
   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start ngrok:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

3. Copy the HTTPS forwarding URL (e.g., `https://5316-2401-4900-4e7e-90f5-5d65-9a3f-9f74-787f.ngrok-free.app`)

4. Update your GitHub App's webhook URL with this ngrok URL + `/webhooks/github`

5. Install the app on your desired repository (from the app's settings page).

**Note**: The ngrok URL changes each time you restart ngrok unless you have a paid account. Update your GitHub App's webhook URL whenever it changes.

## Usage

After setup, Spamurai will automatically:

1. Listen for webhook events from GitHub
2. Process events according to the Motia.dev agent workflows
3. Perform actions like commenting on PRs or closing them based on configured rules

The app demonstrates how to build AI-powered GitHub automation using the Motia.dev framework.

## Motia.dev Integration

Spamurai leverages the [Motia.dev](https://motia.dev) AI Agent Framework to:

- Create intelligent workflows that respond to GitHub events
- Generate contextually relevant PR comments using OpenAI
- Make smart decisions about PR management based on content analysis
- Showcase how engineers can build AI-powered tools with minimal overhead

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Receiving Events

- Verify your ngrok URL is correctly set in the GitHub App settings
- Check that the webhook secret matches between GitHub and your `.env` file
- Ensure your app is installed on the repository you're testing with

### Authentication Issues

- Verify your `GITHUB_APP_ID` and `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` are correct
- Check that your app has the necessary permissions

### Webhook Payload Errors

- Review GitHub's webhook documentation for [event payloads](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads)
- Add logging to see the incoming webhook data
